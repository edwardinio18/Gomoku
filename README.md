## Overview
Gomoku, also known as Five in a Row, is a classic board game played on a grid. The objective of the game is to be the first player to get five of their pieces in a row, either horizontally, vertically, or diagonally.

This project aims to implement a Gomoku game with the following features:

- Interactive gameplay with a graphical user interface (GUI)
- Single-player mode against an AI opponent
- Multiplayer mode for two players
- Customizable game settings (window size, board size, etc.)
- Score tracking and leaderboard
